# Project Overview

Crypto Portfolio is a full-stack application that lets users track cryptocurrency holdings, manage wallets, and perform peer-to-peer coin transfers inside the app. It includes:

- A Node/Express backend that handles authentication, wallets, transactions and notifications.
- A React frontend (Create React App) for the user interface.
- MongoDB for persistence.

Goals
- Provide a simple, educational platform to simulate crypto wallets and transfers.
- Demonstrate end-to-end flows: user registration, login, adding funds, sending/receiving coins, and notifications.

Audience
- Developers working on the project, contributors, and testers.
